# Blender Addon Template

A simple template for getting started with addon development in Blender.

# Dev Setup (VS Code)

1. install recommended extensions.

2. install [`fake-bpy-module`](https://github.com/nutti/fake-bpy-module):

    ```
    pip install fake-bpy-module
    ```
    (optional: setup a virtual python environment first so it's only local to the workspace)
